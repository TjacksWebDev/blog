 ## Week 3 of Coders Campus Bootcamp: Recovering from Sickness and Completing the Higher/Lower Guessing Game

This week at Coders Campus Bootcamp was a bit challenging, as I was still recovering from the cold that I caught last week. However, I was determined to stay on track, so I made an effort to watch some of the video lessons that I had missed. I also started working on my Higher/Lower Guessing Game assignment.

The Higher/Lower Guessing Game is a classic game where the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game gives the player feedback by telling them whether their guess is too high or too low. The player has 5 guesses to try to guess the correct number.

I found the Higher/Lower Guessing Game assignment to be a bit challenging, but also very rewarding. I learned a lot about Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. I also learned how to write more efficient and readable code.

In the end, I was able to complete the Higher/Lower Guessing Game assignment ahead of schedule. I'm really proud of myself for persevering, even when I wasn't feeling my best.
Here is a picture of my code:

Here are some tips that I learned from my experience this week:

* It's okay to take breaks when you need them. Don't try to force yourself to learn or code when you're not feeling up to it.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. Your instructors and classmates are there to support you.
* Breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones can make them seem less daunting.
* Celebrating your successes, no matter how small they may seem, can help you stay motivated.

I'm looking forward to the next week of Coders Campus Bootcamp. I'm excited to learn more about Java and to start working on more challenging projects.
