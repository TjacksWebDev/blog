#Week 1 @ Coders Campus Bootcamp<br/><br/>
________________________________________________________________
1 week down, 23 to go!<br/><br/>
I'm so excited to be finished with my first week at Coders Campus Bootcamp. This week, I got to review some of my prior knowledge on HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web. I had learned this information on my own, but having the review helped me to put all those building blocks together into a cohesive project for the first time. I learned about HTML tags, CSS classes, and how to create basic layouts and styles. I also completed my first assignment, which was to create a simple website.(See my assignment in picture.) üòç<br/><br/>

I'm feeling challenged but motivated, and I'm excited to learn more about Java in the coming weeks.

Check back each week for my next update on my bootcamp journey!

If you're thinking about a career in tech, I highly recommend checking out Coders Campus. They have a great curriculum and a supportive community.<br/><br/>

**Week 2 of Coders Campus Bootcamp
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Java Objects: A Challenge and a Triumph**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm so excited to be halfway through my second week of Coders Campus Bootcamp! 
This week, we learned about Java objects, which are the building blocks of all Java programs. 
I found this topic to be challenging at first, but I eventually got the hang of it.

One of the challenges I faced was understanding how to create and use methods in Java objects. 
I had never worked with methods before, so it took me some time to wrap my head around them. 
But with the help of my instructor and my classmates, I was able to overcome this challenge.

Another challenge I faced was understanding how to inherit from Java objects. 
Inheritance is a way to reuse code, and it can make your code more efficient and easier to maintain. 
I was initially confused about how inheritance worked, but I eventually understood it after working through some practice problems.

Overall, I'm really glad that I took the time to learn about Java objects. 
This is a fundamental concept in Java programming, and it's essential for understanding how Java programs work. 
I'm confident that this knowledge will help me as I continue my journey to become a Java developer.

I'm also proud of myself for overcoming the challenges I faced this week. It wasn't easy, but I persevered and I learned a lot. 
I'm excited to see what I can learn in the coming weeks!
