#Week 1 @ Coders Campus Bootcamp<br/><br/>
________________________________________________________________
1 week down, 23 to go!<br/><br/>
I'm Ty, a coding bootcamp student at Coders Campus.
I'm so excited to be finished with my first week at Coders Campus Bootcamp. This week, I got to review some of my prior knowledge on HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web. I had learned this information on my own, but having the review helped me to put all those building blocks together into a cohesive project for the first time. I learned about HTML tags, CSS classes, and how to create basic layouts and styles. I also completed my first assignment, which was to create a simple website.(See my assignment in picture.) üòç<br/><br/>

I'm feeling challenged but motivated, and I'm excited to learn more about Java in the coming weeks.

Check back each week for my next update on my bootcamp journey!

If you're thinking about a career in tech, I highly recommend checking out Coders Campus. They have a great curriculum and a supportive community.<br/><br/>

**Week 2 of Coders Campus Bootcamp
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Java Objects: A Challenge and a Triumph**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm so excited to be halfway through my second week of Coders Campus Bootcamp! 
This week, we learned about Java objects, which are the building blocks of all Java programs. 
I found this topic to be challenging at first, but I eventually got the hang of it.

One of the challenges I faced was understanding how to create and use methods in Java objects. 
I had never worked with methods before, so it took me some time to wrap my head around them. 
But with the help of my instructor and my classmates, I was able to overcome this challenge.

Another challenge I faced was understanding how to inherit from Java objects. 
Inheritance is a way to reuse code, and it can make your code more efficient and easier to maintain. 
I was initially confused about how inheritance worked, but I eventually understood it after working through some practice problems.

Overall, I'm really glad that I took the time to learn about Java objects. 
This is a fundamental concept in Java programming, and it's essential for understanding how Java programs work. 
I'm confident that this knowledge will help me as I continue my journey to become a Java developer.

I'm also proud of myself for overcoming the challenges I faced this week. It wasn't easy, but I persevered and I learned a lot. 
I'm excited to see what I can learn in the coming weeks!

## Week 2 Done- Coders Campus Bootcamp Journey Update: Feeling Sick But Staying Motivated


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'm Ty, a coding bootcamp student at Coders Campus. I'm currently in week 3 of 24 weeks, and I wanted to share a quick update on my journey so far.

This past week was a bit of a low productivity week for me, as I came down with a nasty cold. I was still able to lightly watch some code tutorials, but I didn't have the energy to do much coding myself.

One thing I did do this week was resubmit my first assignment, after fixing the sources for my images to relative paths instead of absolute paths. This was a small change, but it's important to learn good coding practices early on.

I'm feeling a bit better now, and I'm excited to get back to coding this week. I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far, and I'm learning a lot.

Here are some tips that I've found helpful for staying motivated when learning to code:

* Set realistic goals for yourself. Don't try to learn everything at once.
* Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.
* Take breaks when you need them. Don't try to force yourself to code when you're not feeling up to it.
* Find a coding buddy or community to support you.
* Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

I'm confident that I can catch up on the work that I missed this week, and I'm excited to continue my coding journey. I'll keep you updated on my progress!

### Additional notes:

* In the next week, I plan to focus on learning more about JAVA. I also want to start working on some of my own coding projects.
* I'm also going to try to get more involved in the Coders Campus community. I've heard that there are some great online and in-person events that I can attend.
* I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far, and I'm excited to see what the next 22 weeks bring!
