#Week 1 @ Coders Campus Bootcamp
1 week down, 23 to go!
I'm so excited to be finished with my first week at Coders Campus Bootcamp. This week, I got to review some of my prior knowledge on HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web. I had learned this information on my own, but having the review helped me to put all those building blocks together into a cohesive project for the first time. I learned about HTML tags, CSS classes, and how to create basic layouts and styles. I also completed my first assignment, which was to create a simple website.(See my assignment in picture.) üòç

I'm feeling challenged but motivated, and I'm excited to learn more about Java in the coming weeks.

Check back each week for my next update on my bootcamp journey!

If you're thinking about a career in tech, I highly recommend checking out Coders Campus. They have a great curriculum and a supportive community.
