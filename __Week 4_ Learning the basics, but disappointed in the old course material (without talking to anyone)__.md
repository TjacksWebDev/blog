# **Week 4: Learning the basics, but disappointed in the old course material (without talking to anyone)**

This week in my software engineer bootcamp at Coders Campus, we learned about POJOs, getters, and setters. POJOs, or Plain Old Java Objects, are simple Java classes that are used to represent data. Getters and setters are methods that allow you to get and set the values of the properties of a POJO.

I am really enjoying learning about the basics of programming in Java. It is a very powerful language, and I am excited to learn more about it. However, I am a little disappointed in the fact that the videos for the course have not been updated in 4 years.

For a bootcamp that costs almost $15,000, I would expect the course material to be more up-to-date. There have been a lot of changes in the world of software development in the past 4 years, and I am worried that I am not learning the most up-to-date skills.

To address this, I have been supplementing the course material with more up-to-date tutorials from YouTube. I have found this to be very helpful, and I am learning a lot.

I am still hopeful that the team will update the course videos soon. In the meantime, I am doing my best to learn as much as I can from the current material, and I am supplementing my learning with more up-to-date resources.

**Plan to encourage the update of all videos in the next meetup 1-on-1**

I plan to bring up the issue of the old course videos in my next 1-on-1 meetup with my instructor. I will politely explain that I am concerned about the fact that the videos are not up-to-date, and I will ask what the team is doing to address this issue. I will also encourage the team to update all of the course videos, not just the ones for week 4.

I am hopeful that my instructor will be receptive to my feedback. I think it is important for bootcamps to have up-to-date course material, and I believe that updating the videos would be a valuable improvement to the program.
