# Taking a Sick Day in Software Developer Bootcamp

I'm a software developer student in the Coders Campus bootcamp, and I'm currently in my second week of the 24-week cohort. I'm feeling really sick today. I have a fever, a sore throat, and I'm just exhausted. I've been learning Java variables and working on my drills, but I know I need to take a break today to rest and get better.

I know that some people might think that taking a sick day in a bootcamp is a bad idea. They might worry that they'll fall behind or that their classmates will judge them. But I think it's important to take care of yourself, especially when you're feeling sick.

I'm lucky that I'm ahead in my studies, so I don't feel too guilty about taking a day off. I'm going to spend the day resting, drinking fluids, and taking medicine. I'll also try to get some sleep so that I can be back at my best tomorrow.

I know that taking a sick day can be difficult, especially when you're in a demanding program like a software developer bootcamp. But it's important to remember that your health is important. If you're feeling sick, don't be afraid to take a day off. Your body will thank you for it.

Here are some tips for taking a sick day in a software developer bootcamp:

* Be honest with your instructor or TA. Let them know that you're not feeling well and that you need to take a day off.
* Get plenty of rest. This is the best way to help your body heal.
* Drink plenty of fluids. This will help to keep you hydrated and prevent dehydration.
* Take over-the-counter medication to help relieve your symptoms.
* Do not try to push yourself too hard. If you're feeling tired, take a break.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help from your classmates or instructor. They may be able to help you catch up on the material that you missed.

Taking a sick day can be a difficult decision, but it's important to remember that your health is important. If you're feeling sick, don't be afraid to take a day off. Your body will thank you for it.

**In addition to the above, here are some other things to keep in mind when taking a sick day in a software developer bootcamp:**

* Make sure to communicate with your instructor or TA about your absence and when you expect to be back.
* Set up a plan for catching up on the material that you missed. This could involve working with your classmates, asking your instructor for help, or reviewing the material on your own.
* Don't be afraid to take more than one sick day if you need it. Your health is more important than anything else.
