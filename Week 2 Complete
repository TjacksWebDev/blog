## Week 2 Done- Coders Campus Bootcamp Journey Update: Feeling Sick But Staying Motivated

I'm Ty, a coding bootcamp student at Coders Campus. I'm currently in week 3 of 24 weeks, and I wanted to share a quick update on my journey so far.

This past week was a bit of a low productivity week for me, as I came down with a nasty cold. I was still able to lightly watch some code tutorials, but I didn't have the energy to do much coding myself.

One thing I did do this week was resubmit my first assignment, after fixing the sources for my images to relative paths instead of absolute paths. This was a small change, but it's important to learn good coding practices early on.

I'm feeling a bit better now, and I'm excited to get back to coding this week. I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far, and I'm learning a lot.

Here are some tips that I've found helpful for staying motivated when learning to code:

* Set realistic goals for yourself. Don't try to learn everything at once.
* Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.
* Take breaks when you need them. Don't try to force yourself to code when you're not feeling up to it.
* Find a coding buddy or community to support you.
* Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

I'm confident that I can catch up on the work that I missed this week, and I'm excited to continue my coding journey. I'll keep you updated on my progress!

### Additional notes:

* In the next week, I plan to focus on learning more about JAVA. I also want to start working on some of my own coding projects.
* I'm also going to try to get more involved in the Coders Campus community. I've heard that there are some great online and in-person events that I can attend.
* I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far, and I'm excited to see what the next 22 weeks bring!
